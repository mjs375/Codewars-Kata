# Working with JSON Data in Python
- the *de facto* standard for information exchange, be it gathering API information or storing data in a document database.
  - **JavaScript Object Notation**: *though it was inspired by Javascript, it is now its own standard, so you don't need JavaScript actually*
   - Example ```file.JSON```:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "hobbies": ["running", "sky-diving", "singing"],
  "age": 35,
  "children": [
    {
      "firstName": "Alice",
      "age": 6
    }
    {
      "firstName": "Bobby",
      "age": 8
    }
  ]
}
```
