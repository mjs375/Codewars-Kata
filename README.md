### About Me:
I am currently a public reference librarian in New Jersey who is interested in branching out to the programming field. My formal experience includes courses during my Rutgers University graduate program, an internship at Milne Library, SUNY Geneseo that included proofreading & editing XML code for the *Digital Thoreau* project, and finally, ongoing, self-directed coursework from Harvard as well as online programming practice, e.g. Codewars.

### Languages / Tools Experienced In:
- **SQLite**: *a light-weight relational database used in Django (rarely used in production) [Structured Query Language]*
  - **Postgres**: **
- WebScraping:
- ```★★★★☆``` **Microsoft Excel**: *a spreadsheet program to collect and sort data, make calculations, create charts & graphs, and conduct analysis using Excel functions.*

Skill | Level | Desc. | Misc.
------|-------|-------|------
**Bootstrap** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– pre-written, open-source CSS that programmers can use (by importing and assigning relevant class/id names to an element), thus not wasting time creating universal styles from scratch.*</details></p> | [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
**C** | ★★☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a high-level language that, unlike Python, needs to be 'compiled' into machine-readable code before it is run.*</details></p> | 
**CSS** | ★★★☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*the styling of a webpage– colors, font styles, borders & margins, mobile adaptation, animations, &c. <br>– Cascading Style Sheets (.css)*</details></p> | 
**Django** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a framework for Python & SQL centered around Models-Templates-Views, that easily builds websites, and even includes an admin module for easy data/DB editing.*</details></p> |
**Flask** | ★★☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a lightweight web framework for __Python__.*</details></p> | 
**Git** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a terminal command which lets users manage versions of source-code (e.g. connect & interact with Github.com)*</details></p> |
**Github** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a site which allows users to store & manage source-code and conduct version control.*</details></p> | 
**HTML** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– the static structure & content of a webpage, styled by __CSS__ and made dynamic/interactive with __JS__. <br>– HyperText Markup Language (.html)*</details></p> | 
**JavaScript** | ★★☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a programming language that makes a website dynamic and interactive. Often client-side, meaning the client's web browser processes it rather than a more length web request to the web server.*</details></p> |
**Jinja** | ★★★☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a templating-language that allows __Python__ functions & variables to be inserted into HTML templates, used in both the __Flask__ & __Django__ frameworks.*</details></p> |
**Python** | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– an interpreted programming language (no need to compile into 'machine code' first).*</details></p> |
**SASS** | ★☆☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– an extension of CSS that allows the user of variables and other advanced features like inheritance when creating large, complicated stylesheets.<br>– Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets (.scss)*</details></p> |
**WebScraping** | ★☆☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– *<br>Beautiful Soup<br>Mechanical Soup<br>urllib</details></p> |

- **Programming Languages:**
      - ```★☆☆☆☆``` **SASS**: *an extension of CSS that lets you use variables ($color:red;)(p{color: $color}) and other advanced features in CSS format style more efficiently. Browsers only recognize .css, so you must 1. download Sass program, 2. run ```$ sass variables.scss:variables.css```, which will create a .css file with the variables 'hard-coded'. Run ```$ sass --watch variables.scss:variables.css``` to automatically change the .css file everytime a change is detected in the .scss file. You can also physically nest element{style} inside other elements{style}, and utilize Sass's "inheritance" feature (%somestyle)(div {@extend %somestyle}). [Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.scss].*
- **Programming Support, Libraries, Misc.:**
    - **Github Actions (workflows)**: *wherein certain actions are performed everytime someone pushes to a git repository (CI/CD), e.g. checking style or that units tests still pass. [.yaml/.yml]*
  - **Selenium + ChromeDriver**: *client-side testing that simulates opening a web browser and interacting with it with a Web Driver. Create a file that interacts with the webpage, running a series of accumulating tests as development advances. The file will run through the website and interact with it at computer-speed, saving time in the long run (rather than doing the full suite of accumulating tests manually).*
  - ```★☆☆☆☆``` **{WebScraping}**: *URRLLIB, BeautifulSoup, MechanicalSoup*
  - **Docker**: *instead of running a program on your own computer, your run it inside a virtual 'container' with specific packages installed, &c.– more importantly, when working on a group project, all the programmers have the exact same specifications. It also works when deployed– the program can be run by clients inside the same container so you don't have to program for every possible computer that could run it. Docker is lighter than a Virtual Machine, in that it is just a container, not an entire virtual computer running its own OS.*
