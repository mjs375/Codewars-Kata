### About Me:
- I am currently a public reference librarian in New Jersey who is interested in branching out to the programming field. My formal experience includes courses during my Rutgers University graduate program, an internship at Milne Library, SUNY Geneseo that included proofreading & editing XML code for the *Digital Thoreau* project, and finally, ongoing, self-directed coursework from Harvard as well as online programming practice, e.g. Codewars.

  - **Postgres**: **
- WebScraping:
- ```★★★★☆``` **Microsoft Excel**: *a spreadsheet program to collect and sort data, make calculations, create charts & graphs, and conduct analysis using Excel functions.*

**Bootstrap**<br>```framework``` ```CSS``` | ★★★★☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– pre-written, open-source CSS that programmers can use (by importing and assigning relevant class/id names to an element), thus not wasting time creating universal styles from scratch.*</details></p> | | | [:information_source:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
**C**<br>```lang``` | ★★☆☆☆ | <p><details><summary>:bookmark:</summary>*– a high-level language that, unlike Python, needs to be 'compiled' into machine-readable code before it is run.*</details></p> |

- **Programming Languages:**
- **Programming Support, Libraries, Misc.:**
  - **Selenium + ChromeDriver**: *client-side testing that simulates opening a web browser and interacting with it with a Web Driver. Create a file that interacts with the webpage, running a series of accumulating tests as development advances. The file will run through the website and interact with it at computer-speed, saving time in the long run (rather than doing the full suite of accumulating tests manually).*
  - **Docker**: *instead of running a program on your own computer, your run it inside a virtual 'container' with specific packages installed, &c.– more importantly, when working on a group project, all the programmers have the exact same specifications. It also works when deployed– the program can be run by clients inside the same container so you don't have to program for every possible computer that could run it. Docker is lighter than a Virtual Machine, in that it is just a container, not an entire virtual computer running its own OS.*
