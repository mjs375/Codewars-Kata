## TUTORIAL


### PYTHON COMMENTS
- Any code after a '\#' will not be read by the interpreter
- Any code in-between """...""" will be read as a string literal, but since it isn't assigned to a variable it will simply be ignored

## STRINGS
    - *Strings are immutable, so to 'update a string' you must assign the string to a new one with the changes.*
- **string_name = "Some message"** *Strings can be in ".." or '..'*
- multiline_string = """Some message,  
continued on another line,  
continued on a third line.""" **
