#SYNTACTICALLY AWESOME STYLE SHEETS

### Preprocessing
- ```$ npm install -g sass```
- **Convert ```scss``` to ```css```:** ```$ sass stylesheet.scss style.css```
  - *converts .scss to .css (can rename in the process)*
- **Auto-convert ```scss``` to ```css```:** ```$ sass --watch input.scss output.css```
  - *rather than manually re-compiling the CSS file with every ```.scss``` change, the watch flag tells Sass to watch the source file for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass.*
