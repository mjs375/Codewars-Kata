# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Programming Paradigms
- **Object-Oriented:** *structuring of programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual __objects__. Objects are the center of OOP, not just in representing data, but the overall structure of the program.*
  - **Object:** *represents an entity with __properties__, e.g. a Person with a Name, Age, Address, and __behaviors__ (like walking, speaking); or an Email, with properties such as a Recipient List, Subject, Body, and behaviors like adding attachments and ending.*
- **Procedural/Functional:** *structures a program like a recipe, i.e. a series of steps in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially to complete a task.*


### Classes
- **Primitive Data Structures**: *represent simple pieces of information, e.g. strings, integers, lists.*
  - **Example List:** ```kirk, spock  = ["James Kirk", 34, "Captain", 2256], ["Spock", 35, 2254]
    - **Flaws:** *difficult to manage, remembering just what kirk[#] exactly is, errors if all employees don't have the same number of elements in a list...*
- **Classes:** *used to create user-defined data structures.*
  - **Methods:** *class-defined functions, which ID behaviors and actions that an object can perform with its data.*
  - **Class vs. Instance:** *the Class is the blueprint, the 'idea' of a dog (that a Dog has a name, age, breed); an Instance is one actual Dog (Spot, age 3, dalmatian).*
