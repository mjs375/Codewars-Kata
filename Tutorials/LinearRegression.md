# LINEAR REGRESSION
### Why?
- **Machine Learning:** *Creating programs to solve problems without really telling it how to do so, besides providing it a framework and feeding it data to 'train' on.*
  -Types: *classification models, regression models, decision trees... linear regression!* 


### Linear Regression
- Attempts to model the relationship between 2 variables by fitting a linear equation (a line) between ('on average') the data-set.
  - Once we have set a line, we can use that equation to further predict unknown values.
- **Our Problem:** *does the price of a barrel of oil impact (significantly) the price of a single share of Exxon-Mobile stock?*
  - **Data**: *date, oil_price, stock_price*
