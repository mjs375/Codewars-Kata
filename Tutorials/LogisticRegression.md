# LOGISTIC REGRESSION


### Classification
- **Classification:** *supervised machine learning that tries to predict which class or category some entity belongs to, based on its features, with some mathematical expression. E.g. analyzing company employees and trying to establish a dependence on some __feature__ or __variable___, like level of education, number of years in role, age, salary, &c.*
  - **Observation:** *the set of data related to one entity.*
  - **Variables:** *variables, of __features__, of the data.*
    - **Independent variables:** *inputs or predictors, these do not depend on other features. (E.g. level of education, age, time in current position.) Usually denoted with (x1, x2, ... xr).*
    - **Dependent variables:** *outputs or reponses, these depend on the independent variables. (E.g. salary, odds for promotion.) Usually denoted with (y0 or y1).*
  - **Regression problems:** *these have continuous and usually unbounded outputs (e.g. estimating the salary as a function of experience and education level).*
  - **Classification problems:** *tend to have discrete and finite outputs, called __classes__ or __categories__.*
    - **Binary/Binomial Classification:** *exactly two classes to choose from (0/1, True/False, positive/negative).*
    - **Multiclass/Multinomial Classification:** *three or more classes of the outputs to choose from.*
