# TESTING & DEBUGGING

## Manual Tests

### ```Print()```
- *the simplest debugger, simply place several ```print()``` statements in your code to examine the computations at each step of your program to ensure it is behaving as you want.*
  - ```print(f"Variable 'x' at step 3 is {x}."```


### ```Try``` / ```Except``` / ( ```Finally```)
- ```try:``` ... ```except:```: *'Try' some code, while the 'Except' code will be run if any Error is encountered (specify a specific error: ```Except IndexError:```)* 
  - ```try: except: finally```: *Try will attempt some code, Except will activate if Try fails... and Finally will run its code along with Try or Except anyway.*
  - ```try: except: else:```: *if no Error is encountered in the Try block, it and the Else branch will run.*
 
  
### Python Interpreter
- ``` $ python3```: *pull up the Python interpreter, where you can run or write Python code.*
- ``` $ from prime import is_prime```: *import your own functions [is_prime() from prime.py] to test.*
  - ```quit()```: *exit the interpreter*
```bash
mjs $ python3
Python 3.8.2 (...)
>>> from prime import is_prime
>>> is_prime(3)
True
>>>
```  

### ```Assert```
- *the assert command tests whether a given function (and supplied parameters) evaluates to ```True```. If it does, nothing will happen, but if it is ```False```, an exception will be thrown. Toss a few of these at the end of your function with some random tests and known tricky-cases to check each time you run the program.*

<table><tr><th>Python</th><th>Console</th></tr><tr><td>

```python
import math
def is_prime(n):
  if n < 2:
    return False
  for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))): # <- bug here
  #for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      return False # (composite)
  return True # no factors found (prime!)
  
  
  
  
assert square(10) == 100
```

</td><td>

```terminal
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "assert.py", line 3, in <module>
    assert square(10) == 100
  AssertionError
```

</td></tr></table>

### ```Test.py```
- *Write a ```test.py``` file that runs ```function()``` inside a ```test_function()```, and, if the input does not equal the expected result, return a print statement. Then call up the python interpreter to run the test as many times as you like.*

```python
from prime import is_prime 
  # ^^your own function in file prime.py
def test_prime(n, expected):
  if is_prime(n) != expected:
    print(f"ERROR on is_prime({n}), expected {expected}")
```

</td><td>
  
```bash
$ python3
>>> from test import test_square
>>> test_prime(5, True)
>>> test_prime(10, False)
>>> test_prime(25, False)
ERROR on is_prime(25), expected False
>>>
```

</td></tr></table>

## Test-Driven Development
*We can still do betterâ€“ every time you fix a bug (or add a new feature), why not automatically test the program with a growing collection of tests? Not only do you only have to write the test once, you keep stacking tests to ensure your program is air-tight, even as it gets more complicated (don't lose earlier capabilities when developing new features accidentally!)*

### Shell Script
- *Automate many command-line tests at once in a shell script (```filename.sh```), which enables you to run a series of terminal commands in one click.*
  - You'll need: ```function.py``` + ```test.py``` + ```tests.sh```.
    - Run the Shell Script: ```$ ./tests.sh```
  - *The shell script will run the test file many times (each with a different input parameter & expected result), which in turn will import the actual function from the original file with the actual program.*
- *The terminal will print the exact same "ERROR on..." statement written in ```test.py``` however many times the test fails (the shell script is literally just running the ```test.py``` file multiple times).*
  - *If you get ```Permission Denied```, you may need to change file permissions:*
    - ```$ cd path/to/file```, ```chmod +x filename```: *gives you run permissions*
```shell
python3 -c "from tests import test_prime; test_prime(1, False)"
python3 -c "from tests import test_prime; test_prime(2, True)"
```



















- **Unittest**: *Python's unnittest library.*
```
<<testings.py>> # filename 
import unittest 
from filename import function_name # function you are debugging
class Tests(unittest.TestCase): # a class containing all tests
  def test_1(self): # testing '1' (must be named 'test_'-something)
  """Check that 1 is not prime.""" # 'docstring' will display when test fails to help debug
  self.assertFalse(is_prime(1)) # self.assertSOMETHING (assertTrue, assertEqual, assertGreater...)
  
  def test_2(self): # testing '2'
  """Check..."""
  self.assertTrue(is_prime(2))
  
if __name__ == "__main__": # Run each of the testing functions:
  unittest.main()
```
  - ```$ python3 testings.py```
    - *Unittest will then spit out to the terminal console some information on the test results. It will start with something like ```...F.F```, which means 'Pass-Pass-Pass-Fail-Pass-Fail'. Then, for each failed test, it will give the name of the test and the docstring description, and a Traceback.*
  
- ```pdb```: *Python's built-in debugger tool, activated from the cmd-line. It runs line by line, showing the code in the console, per your keystroke. At any point ask pdb to show the values of variables instead of the code.*
  - *To run:* ```$ python3 -m pdb filename.py```
    - *Next line of code: press* ```n```
    - *Check full code: press* ```l```
    - *Check variable value: press* ```p``` *and* ```variable_name```






- **Django Server-side Testing**: *use the provided 'tests.py' to run test cases and check for bugs. Add a ```def is_valid_(self):``` test to the class, and/or more in ```test.py```. This will test whether certains functions work as we want.*
  - ```$ python3 manage.py test```: *output is akin to Python's unittest, it will log something like '..FF.F' to show Pass/Fail. Importantly, when this command is run it will 1. create a test database (using your dummy data), 2. run the tests, and 3. destroy the test database.*
```
class class_nameTestCase(TestCase):
  a = Airport.objects.create(code="AA", city="A") # Create dummy data:
  Flights.objects.create(origin=a, destination=b, duration=100) # create dummy data
  # Define some tests to run on the dummy data:
  def test_whattotest(self):
  a = Airport.objects.get(code="AA")
  self.assertEqual(a.departures.count(),3)
```
- More complicated testing [CS50 Notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/notes/7/):
  - **Django Client Testing**: *test whether individual web pages load as intended, simulating the making of requests.*
  - **Selenium**: *test out the client-side code, i.e. the HTML/Javascript on a webpage. Selenium framework simulates opening a web browser in the terminal, using a Web [Chrome]Driver.*


## Coverage
  - a tool that measures code coverage, typically during testing runs. It has 3 phases:
    - 1. **Execution**: *coverage.py runs your code, and monitors it to see what lines were executed.*
    - 2. **Analysis**: *examines your code to determine which lines could have run.*
    - 3. **Reporting**: *combines the above 2 steps to produce a coverage number and an indication of missing execution.*
