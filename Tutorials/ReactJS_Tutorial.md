# REACT JS

### React
- **React** is a library, not a framework. It can help create a powerful Front-End pipeline for a web app.
  - manages specific areas of an app's UI, rather than it in entirety
  - *only concerned with the __V__ in __MVC__*
  
## Create React App
- ```$ npx create-react-app my_app_name``` => ```$ cd my_app_name``` => ```$ npm start```
