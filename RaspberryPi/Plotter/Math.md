# Mathematics of Plotting

### Calculating Belt Length
- **Pythagoras' Theorem**: ```a² + b² = c²```, ```c = √{a² + b²}```
  - B<sub>L</sub> = ``` √{(x)² + (h-y)²}```
  - B<sub>R</sub> = ``` √{(w-x)² + (h-y)²}```

### Shortest Distance between Points
- How can we minimize redundant travel-time between the ends of lines and the starts of the next lines?
  - Travelling Salesman Problem! use ```mlrose``` to solve for shortest travel distance between nodes.
