#### [Pi Hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/#one-step-automated-install)
- *a network-wide ad-blocker, essentially a sinkhole that uses blacklists to grab ads and prevent them from showing up on your devices.*
- **Install:** ```$ curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash ```
- **Access Admin Page:** *[Link](http://pi.hole/admin)*
  - **Change DNS of Devices**: *change the DNS of devices that are going to use Pi Hole as Pi-Hole's IP Address. Remove other DNS.*

#### XY Plotter
- A vintage print device, which consists of a hanging pen strung between two motors. By rolling the motors and changing the length of each belt, the hanging pen can go anywhere on the paper (hung on the wall beneath the motors). A third and final servo is used to lift/drop the pen, and â€“ tada! A working printer.
