#### XY Plotter
- A vintage print device, which consists of a hanging pen strung between two motors. By rolling the motors and changing the length of each belt, the hanging pen can go anywhere on the paper (hung on the wall beneath the motors). A third and final servo is used to lift/drop the pen, and â€“ tada! A working printer.
