# Raspberry Pi Plotter

- **Plotter**: *devices that print images with a pen (rather than the modern inkjet with its dot-matrix).*
- **Types**:
  - **Hanging Wall Plotter**: *a vertical plotter that uses servo/stepper motors to modulate the length of two strings, both of which connect to a hanging gondola-apparatus in the center. By modulating the length of each, the gondola can brought to any point within the drawing area, and a third servo motor can raise or lower the pen.*
